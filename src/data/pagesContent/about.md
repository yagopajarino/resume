## Bio

I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· in August 1997, from argentinian mother and spanish father. I remember the very fisrt computer we had at home, when I was no more than 5 years old. My first memory about internet is (of course) the [dial-up](https://youtu.be/gsNaR6FRuO0).ðŸ¥²

After graduating from high school (2015) I studied Business Administration at Universidad CatÃ³lica Argentina (UCA) between 2016 and 2019.

The very first interest in software appeared after a 2018 newspapper article talking about the usage of data and AI to solve real problems. After that I started learning about data and took the data science course at Digital House while finishing my UCA studies and working part time.

Then, I realized that what really motivates me is to **solve problems** using sotfware, so I took one of the greatest desicion of my life when enrolling into Computer Science at Universidad de Buenos Aires, where I'm studying today.

### Work

My first job was in a small accountability firm, part time, right after finishing high school. The fact it was small allowed me to work in all kind of stuff, like calculating tax payments, settlement of salaries and even tax litigations with AFIP. And the rhythm of change in argentinian tax policies also became a benefit at learning how to adapt to a constantly changing enviroment.

In 2018 I joined Camuzzi Gas, a major residential gas supplier, as an account payable trainee. At first the work was very simple, receiving documentation and registering it into SAP. Around october 2018 I became responsible for preparing documentation for decree [1053/18](https://www.cronista.com/columnistas/Decreto-1053-un-problema-para-las-productoras-de-gas-y-para-el-Estado-20200730-0069.html) a major Macri's administration resolution.

I became a junior analyst at Camuzzi in august 2019 and in april 2020 promoted to senior analyst where I was in charge of natural gas payments, the most important payable accounts of the company. At this point I started using data to improve my work and to provide information requested by other areas in a more solid, dynamic and friendly way, primarly using PowerBI. I also coordinated the response to information requested by the regulatory agency [ENARGAS](https://www.enargas.gob.ar/) and used python and windows CMD scriping to automate processes.

In August 2021 I left Camuzzi. The next months I focused in studying and developing my software skills.

My first freelance project came in november 2021 and since then I've been working as a software developer and data analyst freelance consultant.
