## What is this site?

It is my way of sharing interests, ideas, previous work and education. I'll try to include as much information as a not-only-resume webpage allows. However there is a [resume](./resume) section if that's what you're looking for.

You can know [about me](./about), take a quick view of my [projects](./projects) and explore some funny JavaScript-crafted [stats](./stats).

This web repository is avalible at [github](https://github.com/yagopajarino/resume) under [MIT license](https://github.com/yagopajarino/resume/blob/main/LICENSE). It was created using [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) and inspired in [Michael's](https://mldangelo.com/) page.

Feel free to [contact](./contact) me for any questions or inquiries.
