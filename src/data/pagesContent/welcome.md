## What is this site?

It is my way of sharing interests, ideas, previous work and education. I'll try to include as much information as a not-only-resume-style allows. However there is a [resume](./resume) section if that's what you're looking for.

It was created using [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) and inspired (but not copied) from [Michael's](https://mldangelo.com/) page.

This web repository is avalible at [github](https://github.com/yagopajarino/resume).

Feel free to [contact](./contact) me for any questions or inquiries.
